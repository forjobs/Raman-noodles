## This is the UW DIRECT Winter 2019 Team Project GitHub Repo
Team members (alphabetical by first name): Brandon Kern, Elizabeth Rasmussen, Jon Onorato, Parker Steichen


### Overall Project Objective
This package allows for the autoanalysis of a mixture's Raman spectra. It compares the input mixture spectra against an individual component's spectra contained within an internal database stored and accessable via a Google Drive Team folder. 
    - Note: If a desired component spectra is not in the database, the user has the option to add the individual componet's spectra to the database, thus allowing one to identify it in a mixture's raman spectra.

### Assumptions and Project Scope
A. Baseline subtraction is beyond the scope of this project, thus one of the main assumptions, or pre-steps that need to be done before use of this software is baseline subtraction of a user's mixture raman spectra. 
B. Storing data library that is beyond the components of Formic Acid (Hydrogen, Water, Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide) are beyond the scope of the project at this time.


### Project Breakdown
The project can be thought of as broken down into 3 steps:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Peak fitting and identification
3. Statistical analysis for peak fits

These three sections have their own juypter notebooks with more detail included throught, see those for more detail on the individual steps.

### User Flow: As a user you should follow these steps to apply Raman-Noodles to YOUR data
#### Note: these are major steps that will walk you through the three major steps.

### Future Work
The team will continue working on this project in Spring of 2019 as apart of DIRECT program. Future tasks include:
1. Increasing fuctionality of code for different substances beyond Formic Acid
    a. Increasing the size of the library of component Raman Spectra
2. Applying kinetic analysis to data sets to view the change in decomposition and formation of species given different boundary conditions (temperature, resonance time, and strech goal of pressure)
